# Paper Title

Double-layer distribution of hydronium and hydroxide ions in the air-water interface [ACS Phys. Chem Au 2024, 4, 4, 336–346](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphyschemau.3c00076) [ChemRxiv](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/64a1f26aba3e99daef69917a)

# Dataset and model

The dataset for training the DP model is uploaded to [AIS Square](https://www.aissquare.com/datasets/detail?pageType=datasets&name=SCAN_H2O_H3O_OH&id=243) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14306810).

The compressed DP model is uploaded to [AIS Square](https://www.aissquare.com/models/detail?pageType=models&name=SCAN_H2O_H3O_OH&id=242) and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14306810).

[Voronoi CVs](https://github.com/Zhang-pchao/OilWaterInterface/tree/main/Ion_Diffusion_Coefficient) can be used to calculate the diffusion coefficient for H₃O⁺ or OH⁻ ions.
